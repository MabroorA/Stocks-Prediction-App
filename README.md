# Stocks Prediction Tool
This project aims to develop a stocks investment decision tool through data analysis and simulation. It integrates various APIs for data collection and utilizes machine learning models for prediction. The tool provides allows investors to generate buy / sell signals by analysing historical data and/or enabling to play what if games: what if I had invested Â£1000 how much I would have been well or worse off? in short, we would like to devise investment strategies and then evaluate them.

### Current Features
- Top 5 Gainers and Losers in the stock market is displayed at home page.
- Search Ticker: Search for ticker information for a specific company.
- Search to Display Ticker: Retrieve history daily for previous 5 years for visualization & to download.
- Latest News: Fetch the latest news related to stocks.
- Prediction is done using a LSTM machine learning model with live data to display data for the next 30 days. 
## UI
Currently, the project is in the process of redesigning the User interface to simplify stock research for user.
